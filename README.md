## Getting Started

Code and full instructions will be released here.

- **Install**: dependency file(s) and setup guide will be provided with the code release.
- **Run**: example commands (training / evaluation / demo) will be provided with reproducible configs.

---

## TODO
- [ ] Release code
- [ ] Add installation instructions
- [ ] Add runnable examples (train / eval / demo)

---

## Updates
- **`2026-01-28`**: Initialize README for the upcoming code release.

---

## Acknowledgments
Our method and experiments build on widely used open-source tools and simulators, including (but not limited to):
- **MetaDrive** (driving simulation)
- **Stable-Baselines3** (PPO implementation)
- **PyTorch** (deep learning backend)
- **CARLA / Unreal Engine / RoadRunner** (used in the vehicle-in-the-loop study stack, as described in the paper)
